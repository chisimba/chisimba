FlowPlayer's JavaScript API supports a subset of the JavaScript API
available in mplayer browser plug-in (http://mplayerplug-in.sourceforge.net/).
Additionally it defines some methods that are not available in mplayer 
plug-in. mplayer plug-in's API is documented in javascript.txt that can be found 
in the plugin's source distribution package.

FlowPlayer supports the following JavaScript methods

	DoPlay():Void;
	DoStop():Void;
	Reset()Void;
	Pause()Void;
	Seek(seconds:Number)Void;
	getTime()Void;
	getDuration()Void;

FlowPlayer specific, not in mplayer plug-in API:

	setConfig(flowPlayerConfig:Object):Void
	StartBuffering()Void;
	ToggleLoop()Void;
	getPercentLoaded():Number;
	getIsPlaying():Boolean;
	getIsPaused():Boolean;
	getIsLooping():Boolean;

PlayList control (FlowPlayer specific, not in mplayer plug-in API):

	hasNext():Boolean;
	NextClip():Void;
	PrevClip():Void;
	getPlayListSize():Number;
	getCurrentClip():Number;
